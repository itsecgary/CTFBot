# CTFBot
A discord.py bot providing ctf platform integration and points system for
users on a Discord server. Currently, there are commands for CTFTime, CTFd APIs,
and for team setup.

This bot keeps track of what server members are doing for CTFs. There is a point
system that awards points for when members compete with the team. The bot keeps
track of statistics like number of competitions competed in, points
(from point system), ranking on server, and more.

Future Platform Integration:
- CTFx
- rCTF
- XCTF
- FacebookCTF

### Creds:
We included several utilities from NullCTF's bot. The integration of CTFTime and
CTFd is very useful to this bot and assists the point system as well.
